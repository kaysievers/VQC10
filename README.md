# RFT VQC10 LED 5Ã—7 Matrix Driver

## Notes

For testing purposes the display is able to run with 3.3V, all power and logic
pins driven by a 3.3V microcontroller. The controller does not supply enough
current / power for regular operation, the brightness of the LED row is not
stable when the number of pixels change, and the maximum brightness cannot be
reached.

Floating data / input pins appear to have no defined state, the display might
show random pixels changing their state.

The unit has a 2.5mm pin spacing it fits into a breadboard just fine with some
(unconventional) force applied.
